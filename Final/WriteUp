**** GBA Write up ****
1. Koopa1 will automatically start running in place
2. Koopa2 will automatically start running to the left
3. If koop1 & koopa2 collide then the game will reset
4. The only button functionality is the up arrow key which will allow Koopa1 to jump
5. Be warned... with each jump the scroll and koopa 2 will increase in speed


Additonal comments:
- I tried adding assembly language to add to the speed but it wouldnt compile for me...
  which I commented out 695 and 733 if you wanted to give it a go around.

- Also which each sprite collsion, the screen glitches out but resets the game.
